What are some good examples of continuous probability distribution functions with negative skew?

ChatGPT  
Skewness in a probability distribution refers to its asymmetry. A negative skew indicates that the left tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right tail, with the bulk of the distribution concentrated on the right side. Some examples of continuous probability distribution functions with negative skew include:Gamma Distribution: Depending on the parameters, the gamma distribution can exhibit negative skewness, especially when the shape parameter is less than 1.  
F Distribution: The F distribution can have negative skewness, particularly when the degrees of freedom for the numerator are small compared to the denominator.  
Exponential Distribution: While the exponential distribution is often positively skewed, it can exhibit negative skewness for certain parameter values.  
Log-Normal Distribution: In some cases, the log-normal distribution can be negatively skewed, especially when the underlying normal distribution has a mean less than 1.  
Chi-Squared Distribution: The chi-squared distribution can have negative skewness for small degrees of freedom.  
These distributions can be useful in modeling various phenomena where negative skewness is observed, such as in certain financial data or in certain types of measurement errors.

I thought the chi square distribution always has non-negative skewness.ChatGPT  
You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The chi-squared distribution is an example of a distribution that is always non-negative and right-skewed (positively skewed). The skewness of the chi-squared distribution increases with the degrees of freedom. Thank you for pointing out the error.
