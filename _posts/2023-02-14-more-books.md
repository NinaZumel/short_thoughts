ðŸ“š  Iâ€™ve finished loading up a first round of books to [**The Library of Babble**](https://ninazumel.com/books/). These are all the books that were in my current spreadsheet that had book covers online at the Open Library. The bookshelf template Iâ€™m using can load the covers from the Open Library ID. Handy!

Next comes the rest of the spreadsheet: books for which I have to generate a cover image. Then, I have to finish populating the spreadsheet, with the remaining entries from 2012 and 2011.

Progress! Do check it out.
