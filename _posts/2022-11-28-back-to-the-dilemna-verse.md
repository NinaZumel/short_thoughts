## Back to the dilemna-verse

Earlier today, my husband, who knows he can't spell, asked me how to spell "dilemma." I spelled it to him out loud, the way I have always spelled the word: d-i-l-e-m-**N**-a. And I reflexively added, "Google it, to make sure."

"Here it is," he replied. "Two Ms."

"What?!? No, it's 'M-N'", I said.

"Google says two Ms."

"No!" 

I looked it up myself, positive that this was an instance of a mispelling/malapropism that had become more or less standard, or at least widely used, like people writing "for all intensive purposes" when they mean "for all intents and purposes," or the surprisingly common "defiantly" in place of "definitely."

And I learned that in fact, [it is, and has always been, "dilemma."](https://www.dilemna.info/index.php) A quick trip to our actual, physical *Oxford Dictionary of American English* confirmed this. 

Now that I've stopped to think about it, two Ms makes sense. Di-lemma: two lemmas, or two "propositions," to use *lemma* in its mathematical sense.  To *have a dilemma* is to be in a situation with two (or more) choices, often both equally undesirable.

So why did I think it was spelled with an N? "Dilemma" doesn't even look right to me. Clearly, I'm not the only one, given that an entire website exists to discuss the issue. There's some kind of [Mandela effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_Effect) going on.

Just for fun, let's entertain Fiona Broome's original theory about the Mandela effect: perhaps all of us who spell the word "dilemna" are refugees from some alternate reality where that spelling is (and has always been) correct.
