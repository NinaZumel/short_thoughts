📽️ Just watched  [*Oddity*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26470109/) (2024).  A horror blogger I follow described it as a "supernatural whodunnit" -- which sounded perfect, to me! They turned it off for being too whodunnit and not enough horror, but I thought the creepiness was just right. I enjoyed it.
