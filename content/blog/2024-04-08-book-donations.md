title: Thinking About Book Donations
---
I've been thinking about donating some books, to get my overflowing bookshelves under control. I've already been doing that on a small scale, a couple of books at a time, to the [Little Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/)box down the street from me, but now I'm thinking about larger donations, too.

[The Internet Archive controlled lending library](https://openlibrary.org/bookdrive) (aka [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)) is an attractive thought, especially since I take advantage of it often, myself. There is a chance that it may go away, though, since Big Publishing and even many authors seem intent on equating Open Library with piracy and outlawing it. It's not piracy, it's a library in exactly the sense a physical one is, but, that's a different rant....

Of course I thought of my local library (San Francisco Public Library), too. It turns out they don't put donated books in circulation, they [sell them](https://www.friendssfpl.org/donatebooks.html). That's not a bad thing; the library needs the money. But somehow, as a donor, it doesn't feel quite the same. Turning a book into money doesn't feel the same as sharing or passing on a book, you know?

Anyway, still thinking about what to do.
