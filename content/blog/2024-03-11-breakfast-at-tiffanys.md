[**$1.5M One-off Custom Binding of Signed First Edition of _Breakfast at Tiffany's_**](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/15m-one-custom-binding-signed-first-edition-breakfast-tiffanys) in honor of the centenary of Truman Capote's birth. It's beautiful! But as someone who believes books should be for reading (even the collectible ones), I can't help feeling like this is a waste.
