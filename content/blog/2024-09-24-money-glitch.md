title: The ur-money glitch fraud
---
While reading a [*Strand* article from 1907](https://archive.org/details/TheStrandMagazineAnIllustratedMonthly/TheStrandMagazine1907bVol.XxxivJul-dec/page/n418/mode/1up?view=theater) by Austin Philips, a writer who had worked as an investigator for the British Post Office, I came across this passage, about fraud in Britain's Postal Savings system.

> The introduction of the system of "withdrawal on demand" was responsible for an avalanche of frauds, though they were necessarily limited in result, since, by the regulations, not more than a pound can be withdrawn at any one time. One ingenious gentleman opened a number of accounts by depositing a shilling at various offices in different names.  Having thus obtained a number of deposit books, he set about altering the entries to larger amounts, and then proceeded to withdraw a pound where he had deposited a shilling. His career was not, however, a lengthy one. 

So basically, the "Chase Money Glitch" shenanigans, over a century earlier.
