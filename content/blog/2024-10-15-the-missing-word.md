I've posted an Austin Philips Post Office ghost story up on _Dark Tales Sleuth_, from _Pall Mall Magazine_, November 1909. In [**"The Missing Word"**](https://ninazumel.com/dark_tales_sleuth/austin-philips/the-missing-word/), an old telegraph operator tells his colleagues about the night he "heard" his fellow telegraphist's murder.
