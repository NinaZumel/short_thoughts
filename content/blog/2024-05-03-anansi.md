I'm starting a new short series on my blog, retelling myths about the origins of stories. It was inspired by Rosalind Kerven's article "The Mythical Origins of Myths," for the Folklore Society newsletter. 

The first one is from Ghana: [*How Anansi Bought the World's Stories*](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2024/05/03/how-anansi-bought-the-worlds-stories/).
