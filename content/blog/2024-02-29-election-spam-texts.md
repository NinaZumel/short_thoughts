I think I said this last year, too, but I *cannot wait* for our March 5 primary elections to be over so all this phone spam will cease! It's an incredible disincentive to donate to candidates and political causes, too, knowing that your email or phone number or whatever is going to be sold to everyone and their cousin. Just take my money do what I gave it to you for, already.
