title: What I've Been Up To
---
I've not been very good about updating this, so here's a little summary of what I've been doing since the last time I posted.

On **the technical side**, I've written a couple of articles on adjusting linear models to account for what I call "zero-saturation." This was work we did for a client who had some linear models to estimate count data, which of course can't be negative. Their assumption was that zero-counts would be rare in all situations. They aren't. So this work relates to a solution we came up with for them.

* [Post-hoc Adjustment for Zero-Thresholded Linear Models](https://win-vector.com/2024/08/16/post-hoc-adjustment-for-zero-thresholded-linear-models/) -- on the Win-Vector blog.
* [Adjusting Saturated Models](https://ninazumel.com/blog/2024-08-20-saturated-models/) -- a followup article, on the ninazumel.com blog.

On the **non-technical side**, I indulged myself in [a little game of "What if?" with Star Wars, and how the force works.](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2024/08/22/playing-what-if-with-star-wars/)

I also moved my literary sleuthing blog [*Dark Tales Sleuth*](https://ninazumel.com/dark_tales_sleuth/) away from Wordpress to a static web site (Github Pages). It just made more sense that way. It's a complete migration, including the comments, so that was nice.
