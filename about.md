As I say [somewhere else](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2022/10/29/trying-a-new-syndication-strategy-on-micro-blog/), I've gotten disenchanted with the low visibility of announcing my posts to Facebook or Twitter. I'm also not in love with the high toxicity of Twitter, in particular. But I still feel the need to share my posts to the world, somehow. So I'm trying something different.

Instead of posting to Twitter, I'll be announcing new posts at Micro.blog, via this site. You'll hear about posts from all my blogs:
[Multo](https://multoghost.wordpress.com), [Ephemera](https://exiw.wordpress.com), [Dark Tales Sleuth](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com), 
and even [NinaZumel.com](ninazumel.com).

You can follow [@MultoGhost](https://micro.blog/MultoGhost) at Micro.blog, or follow me here via RSS.
