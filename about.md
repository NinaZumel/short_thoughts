I have a lot of personal blogs, to cover a variety of related interests. I've never done a lot of work to publicize my posts, relying mostly on Facebook interest groups, the Wordpress Reader, and Twitter.

Over the years, I've grown disenchanted with the low visibility of announcing my posts to Twitter. Facebook works a little better, if I happen to write something of interest to an interest group that I follow. But honestly, these days I've not had any great desire to check in with either of those sites.

And yet, I still feel the need to share my posts to the world, somehow. Hence, this little space.

### My Blogs

[Multo(Ghost)](https://multoghost.wordpress.com): my primary blog, where I blog about the supernatural in literature and popular culture. Ghost stories, folklore, and whatever I feel like writing about.

[Ephemera](https://exiw.wordpress.com): Lately, I've been using this blog mostly for my translations of public domain, Spanish language supernatural short fiction.

[Dark Tales Sleuth](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com): A blog I use for my forays into "literary sleuthing": tracking down author attributions and original publication sources of unattributed (usually public domain) works.

[NinaZumel.com](ninazumel.com): My professional presence online.
