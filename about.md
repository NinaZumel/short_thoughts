As I say [somewhere else](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2022/10/29/trying-a-new-syndication-strategy-on-micro-blog/):

> Up until now, I’ve publicized my blog posts on Twitter and Facebook. This is not a terribly effective strategy, 
> for a variety of reasons most people summarize as “The Algorithm.” 
> And as time goes by, my appetite for logging on to those sites has dwindled to non-existent — again, thanks to “The Algorithm.” 
> And yet, I still feel the need to let the world know when I’ve written something. So, I’m going somewhere different.

Instead of posting to Twitter, I'll be announcing new posts at Micro.blog, via this site. You'll hear about posts from all my blogs:
[Multo](https://multoghost.wordpress.com), Ephemera[https://exiw.wordpress.com], [Dark Tales Sleuth](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com), 
and even [NinaZumel.com](ninazumel.com).
